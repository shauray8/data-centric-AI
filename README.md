[Convert images to gray scale](./data-ai/convert.py)

## What is this all about ?

## Initial Ideas for the challange 
* Maybe I should first try to clean the data by hand (ofcourse)
* Write a GAN to make some more roman numerals (cause I can submit upto 10,000 images)
* Some augmentations (not sure which one will make the data better)
